# Machine Learning with a focus on practical applications for real-world data analysis

## Overview
My coursework and project for Machine Learning course at the SDU.

## Description
Applying machine learning algorithms in Python, covering topics from basic machine learning fundamentals to advanced algorithms. Emphasized to demonstrate real-world application of the concepts learned.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow.
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda.

## Projects
Each folder in this repository represents projects and assignments completed throughout the course:
- `project_1`: Introduction to Machine Learning Basics.
- `project_2`: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.
- Further projects explore Deep Learning, Model Evaluation, and Automated ML techniques.

## Installation
To run the projects locally:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
